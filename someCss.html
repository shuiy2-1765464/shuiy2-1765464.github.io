        <p class="p2">Uncle Pecos:"You know darn well I can't play without a guitar string.
            He is known to be always singing with a guitar, with a black cowboy hat that covers his eyes. 
            He gets angry at Tom every time one of his guitar strings snap, because he plucks one whisker off of his face to replace it, 
            and, at one point, took one of Tom's claws to use as a guitar pick. He is voiced by Shug Fisher in Tom and Jerry and Jim Cummings 
            in Tom and Jerry Tales. He also appears in The Tom and Jerry Show (2014) voiced by Stephen Stanton."
